# Links 
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Relative links
You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:

[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Images

You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.
